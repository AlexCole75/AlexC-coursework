    <u><ul><h4><ul>S6 Advanced Higher project</ul></h4></ul></u>
    <p>For my Advanced Higher Computing Science project, I had to come up with an idea for a website or program which will do some type of functionality in some type of way for my project to be excepted. I decided to make a website. The idea was to create a social media website, the user can create a profile, log in, search for friends and speak to them. For the project I user HTML, PHP, CSS, SQL and JavaScript. This website would be connected to an external database, which would store the users first name, last name, username and password. When they create a profile, each input would be put through validation. The user will need to input their desired password twice to make sure it’s the password that they wanted, and it checks to make sure they both match. Once the validation is done the profile is created and stored in the database and the user can now log in. The user logs in and the website checks the database to make sure that the account exists and if it does makes sure that the password matches the account and logs them in if it is. The user will be taken to their profile and will now be able to speak to people and search for people. This project took from the beginning from S6 to the end of S6 and was very frustrating to work with as it was the first time I was making a website with PHP, SQL, a database and JavaScript but I’m glad I made the website as it allows me to develop my skills and knowledge with the code I didn’t know, and it showed me how it works and how websites function like this.

    <p>The above picture is a screenshot from my website, when the user clicks onto the website this is the first page they are brought to. It’s the main page where it allows the user to log into an account if they have a active account or they can create a profile for them to use after it had been created.</p> <!-- paragraph tag that explains my project -->

    <p>The above picture is a screenshot from a profile that I created and its to show what the profiles look to the user. When they log in the main features are the search functionality to search for friends, the chat box and chat display box where the user can speak and chat to the user that message them.</p> <!-- paragraph tag that explains my project -->
