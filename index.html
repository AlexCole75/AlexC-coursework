    <p>Welcome to my home page of my website, this website is being designed for an assessment for the Computing Information Systems module in my Computing Science course. The idea was to build a website with four main pages. The home page which will be the first page that the user will see and can read this message to understand the website. The second page is my projects which will hold any projects that I have created or any ideas that I may have for a project. The third page is my CV page which will hold my CV for users to click on and look through and use this to promote myself to the world. The fourth page is the contact page where it has my phone number and E-mail on it for anyone to contact me over my projects, my CV or anything else. On the left-hand side of the website is the four links to navigate the website. Use the links to go on to another page of the website.</p> <!-- paragraph tag that explains the use of the website -->
